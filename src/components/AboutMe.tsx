                <p>As a former fisheries biologist on the Bering Sea, I've transitioned to the world of web development, swapping the rocking boat for a stable standing desk. From battling waves to debugging code, I've learned that adaptability is key, whether at sea or in the ever-evolving landscape of programmingâ€”now tackling bugs instead of halibut.</p>

                <p>I'm currently immersed in coding school with Epicodus, honing skills and unlocking new ones. Currently exploring Javascript, React, and C#. Really looking forward to implementing what I've learned at Epicodus while learning new skills on the job.</p>
